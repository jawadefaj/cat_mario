# Cat Mario AI Challenge Project

## Overview
This project, inspired by SethBling's MarI/O and Niko's CrAIg, uses [NEAT (Neural Evolution of Augmented Topologies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) to train an AI for playing "Cat Mario," a challenging Mario-like game. The aim is to develop an AI that learns to navigate through the game's deceptive traps and challenges.

## Dataset and Input-Output Behavior
- **Dataset**: Real-time gameplay video feeds, converted into frames.
- **Input**: Game environment information including character, terrain, enemies, and projectiles.
- **Output**: Simulated keystrokes for the character's movement and actions.
